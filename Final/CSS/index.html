                    <p>Due to the priority of Dragon, this position tends to remain isolated from the rest of the team. Ideal champions for this position are largely self-sufficient with tools to dominate in duels, scale by farming, or impact the map in other ways.</p>

                    <h3>Middle</h3>
                    <img src="mid.png" alt="Random">
                    <p>The middle lane provides the fastest income of gold and experience due to its short distance. The lane's smaller space is also attractive for champions with bad defense (e.g. Mage icon.png mages) to easily retreat to safety under turret. Being in the center of the map, this position has easy access to other sectors similar to the Jungler.</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Bottom</h3>
                    <img src="bot.png" alt="Random">
                    <p>Due to the priority of Dragon, the ADC tends to prioritize control of this lane over others. Ideal champions for Bottom position can optimize the presence of the Support throughout the laning phase.</p>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Jungle</h3>
                    <img src="jungle.png" alt="Random">
                    <p>This position provides a safe avenue to obtain gold and experience through jungle camps, without much interference from opponents. Due to camps being spread out across the map, the player can freely path around the map to influence lanes and secure objectives.
                    </p></div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h3>Support</h3>
                    <img src="support.png" alt="Random">
                    <p>The support position tends to take a passive approach to gold generation in favor of funneling the active income to other positions. The player would instead succeed primarily through providing security or kill potential for their team. This objective is best executed in a side lane due to the close proximity to the opponents and wide area being hard for them to escape from.</p>
